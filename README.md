### DB ERD

DB Schema is available [here](./docs/db/structure.sql)

The sample database relationship is shown as follows:

![db erd](./docs/erd.jpg)


### ðŸ™‡ Nerd Section

The project uses ES6/7 features such as `async/await`, `object destructuring` etc. which is not readily available in Node version 8 or below. 

Hence, there is a build step involved to transpile such features using Webpack and Babel. 

```bash
npm run build
```

Also, to stay alive as a sane Javascript developer, strict `eslint` rules are used. 

```bash
npm run lint
```

Finally, to ease the deployment process, `docker-compose` is used. 

```bash
docker-compose up
```
